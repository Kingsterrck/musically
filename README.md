This is the project I am doing for MYP digital design end-of-year report. Indeed I was supposed to have everything finished by the end of April but earlier it turned out that we did not need to go to any of the on-screen assessments, so in March and April I spent most of my time preparing my 3 AP exams, and did not start the remaining four fifths of the project until late May, which is when I write this README.

# Overlook
The project is based on **MVC structure** because I had previous experience with it (check out my SOP repo). Frontend development utilizes **Bootstrap 4.6.1**, not because anyone told me to do so, but in my last project I spent too much time on frontend and didn't realize the amount of work to build the backend stuff

# feedback
The project is currently in development and expected to be finished on **June 18, 2022**. During this time, any advices are welcomed by either submitting a pull request or contact me by email at kingsterrck@126.com
